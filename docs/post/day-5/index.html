<h2 id="daytime-usage">Daytime usage</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really addressed the daytime power usage yet. To be consistent with the EnergizeApps parser, I&rsquo;ll define &lsquo;day&rsquo; as 5AM - 8PM (inclusive, exclusive). Likewise going forward I should define &lsquo;night&rsquo; as 11PM - 4AM.</p>

<p>I will not only want to look at the overall daytime usage, but isolate the weekday and weekend usage since I&rsquo;d expect the building to be unoccupied on weekends. Once again I get to leverage the handy <code>DatetimeIndex</code> structure which holds a <code>weekday</code> component. This component is an integer which reads as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mon</th>
<th>Tue</th>
<th>Wed</th>
<th>Thu</th>
<th>Fri</th>
<th>Sat</th>
<th>Sun</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>So the weekdays correspond to days 0-4 while weekends are days 5-6.</p>

<pre><code>day_bools = (df_energy.index.hour &gt;= 5) &amp; (df_energy.index.hour &lt; 20)
df_day = df_energy[day_bools]

df_weekday = df_day[df_day.index.weekday &lt;= 4]
df_weekend = df_day[df_day.index.weekday  &gt; 4]
</code></pre>

<p>You can not simply join the conditionals with the <code>and</code> keyword that Python would normally understand. If you did, it would try to evaluate the entire array to either just a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value. Instead you use the <code>&amp;</code> operator to perform an item-wise comparison of all individual element pairs within the boolean arrays.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In hindsight, it would be simpler to use the <code>pandas.DataFrame.between_time</code> function here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now to look at the plots. For overall daytime power distribution we get:</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_day.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_day.png alt="main_day.png not found" title = main_day.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>Another bimodal distribution. At first I assumed this was just because of the distinction between weekday and weekend usage. But the weekend is only 2 days, you would assume that the low-power peak would be much smaller than the high-power peak.</p>

<p>When we look at just the weekend usage we get:</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_weekend.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_weekend.png alt="main_weekend.png not found" title = main_weekend.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>It&rsquo;s a weird shape, but at least it&rsquo;s unimodal. Looking at the weekday usage, things get weirder.</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_weekday.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_weekday.png alt="main_weekday.png not found" title = main_weekday.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>The shape is still bimodal. That means there&rsquo;s some factor here that&rsquo;s still causing a split in the data. Then I remembered, this includes the whole year&rsquo;s worth of data. That includes the 180 days of school time, but also holidays, breaks, and summer vacation. So the heap of low power usage must be primarily from vacation.</p>

<p>To test this, I can look at two charts: one with a month from the summer, and one with a month during the school year. July is a good summer midpoint, and after looking at the Andover academic calendar it looks like the month of March doesn&rsquo;t have many days off from school. I can extract these with the <code>pandas.DatetimeIndex.month</code> property. In this case the index starts at 1 for Jan and extends to 12 for Jan.</p>

<p>The weekday-daytime power distribution for July:</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_july.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_july.png alt="main_july.png not found" title = main_july.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>And for March:</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_march.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_march.png alt="main_march.png not found" title = main_march.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>At first I was baffled, but then once again I realized an oversight. I am defining day as the hours from 5AM-8PM. This isn&rsquo;t a good index to use for a school because school doesn&rsquo;t run the entire day. To put this issue to rest, I&rsquo;m going to isolate March&rsquo;s data between 7:40 and 2:20. I found a <code>pandas.Series.between_time()</code> method in the documentation, I&rsquo;ll use that here and probably change my use of the <code>.hour</code> attribute from earlier. If this doesn&rsquo;t give me a unimodal shape I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>







    


<div align="center">
	<a href=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_march_school.png>
	   <img src=https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/images/06/12/main_march_school.png alt="main_march_school.png not found" title = main_march_school.png />
	</a>
</div>




<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied with this result. In the console I printed the dataset that was registering under 250 kW which consisted of 4 days, 2 of which had no school in 2016 and the other 2 I&rsquo;m guessing didn&rsquo;t have school in 2015. The rest of the distribution looks nice and symmetric.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>All of this work has just made it very clear how necessary it is to implement a robust filtering system to let administrators choose which days to include and exclude to isolate days that follow similar power usage models.</p>

<p>The program won&rsquo;t know what kind of data is being fed to it, and without that info it can&rsquo;t do any useful analysis. It&rsquo;s up to the person running the program to be able to seperate groups of similar data to individually perform analysis upon.</p>

<p>To make this easier, I may implement some feature that detects multiple peaks and looks for patterns within them to suggest how to make further isolations.</p>

<p>Up until this point, most of the programming work has been temporary scripting, but I need to start putting code into usable functions. Filters would be very helpful, so that will be my next task.</p>

<h2 id="templating-the-code">Templating the code</h2>

<p>In my semester at Northeastern I learned about the &ldquo;design recipe&rdquo; which takes a very systematic approach to programming. It&rsquo;s a good habit to have, and I&rsquo;ll loosely follow it here.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;
time_filter: filters data by properties like date and time

ARGS:
data : DataFrame or Series with DateTimeIndex
*timerange: Tuple with start and end time strings as HH:MM
    or list of such tuples
*daterange: Tuple with start and end dates as YYYY-MM-DD
    or list of such tuples.
    Blank Tuple element will default to MIN or MAX
*exclusions: List of dates to be excluded as YYYY-MM-DD
*inclusions: List of dates to be explicity included as YYYY-MM-DD
    This will override the daterange property
*weekdays: List of integers for days to be included
    0 = Mon, 6 = Sun

*starred parameters are optional
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>So I don&rsquo;t forget it later, I recently found out that I can easily implement the <code>daterange</code> and <code>excludions</code> properties with the <code>.loc</code> function. E.g. I can simply type <code>data['2016-03-01':'2016-03-20']</code> to filter between those dates.</p>

<p>This method signature seems to cover all the filtering features that I&rsquo;ve needed so far. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll start making the code for it.</p>
