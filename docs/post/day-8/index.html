<p>I printed the <a href="http://www.aps1.net/DocumentCenter/View/6795">2016-17 Andover District Calendar</a> and got to work entering the data. Ultimately I organized it into two calendars, one for days with no school entirely (which I inputted as &lsquo;all-day&rsquo; events) and one for half days (to ensure sufficient overlap I entered the events starting from 10:50AM when school gets out and ran until 11:59PM at night).</p>

<p>I exported these <code>.ics</code> files, then imported them into python with my <code>.ical</code> range processor:</p>

<pre><code>no_school = egz.ical_ranges('resources/no_school_2016-17.ics')
half_day = egz.ical_ranges('resources/half_days_2016-17.ics')
</code></pre>

<p>The filtering process seemed really smooth:</p>

<pre><code>df_school = egz.time_filter(df_energy,
                        include = ('9/2/16','6/16/17'),
                        blacklist = no_school + half_day,
                        daysofweek=[0,1,2,3,4],
                        times=('07:40','14:20'))
</code></pre>

<p>Except that when I looked at the data I was getting, it wasn&rsquo;t completely right.
First, all of the vacation days were still included because I accidentally exclude <code>exclude</code> instead of <code>blacklist</code>, but I got that sorted out eventually.</p>

<p>Then, I noticed that my half days were not filtering out. Instead of filtering <em>out</em> the half days, I tried solely included the half day ranges to see what was going wrong. The events that should have been starting at 10:50AM were starting at
2:50PM when school would have already been out, hence why they seemed to be missing.</p>

<h2 id="time-zones">Time zones</h2>

<p>Ultimately, I determined the problem to be a timezone conflict. The ranges that my ical function was outputting were in UTC time, which is 4 hours ahead. Based on how smooth things had been going so far, I assumed it would be easy to convert this object to a different timezone, right?</p>

<p>Not quite. This was an incredibly convoluted and time intensive debugging process. I followed a few tutorials online but none were doing what I wanted. I ended up getting it to work, but the result isn&rsquo;t pretty. I had to overhaul the <code>ical_ranges</code> function and make a helper function that handles the timezone conversion. I also had to add a check to see whether the item was a <code>datetime.datetime</code> object (in which case I would perform the conversion) or just a <code>datetime.date</code> object (in which case there&rsquo;s no time to perform any conversions on. Otherwise the program would throw an error.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;
convert_range_tz : DataRange(datetime.datetime), timezone --&gt; DataRange
converts the ical default UTC timezone to the desired timezone
&quot;&quot;&quot;
def convert_range_tz(range_utc, local_tz):
    convert = lambda time: pytz.utc.localize(
        time.replace(tzinfo=None)).astimezone(
                local_tz).replace(tzinfo=None)
    return tuple(map(convert,range_utc))


&quot;&quot;&quot;
ical_ranges: File Path --&gt; ListOf DataRanges
reads the ics file at the given path, and turns the event start and end times
into data ranges that can be read by the time_filter function
&quot;&quot;&quot;
def ical_ranges(file):
    cal = Calendar.from_ical(open(file,'rb').read())
    ranges = []
    cal_tz = pytz.timezone(cal['X-WR-TIMEZONE'])
    for event in cal.subcomponents:
        event_range=(event['dtstart'].dt,event['dtend'].dt)
        if isinstance(event_range[0],datetime.datetime):
            event_range = convert_range_tz(event_range, cal_tz)
        ranges.append(event_range)
    return ranges
</code></pre>

<p>The conversion process is pretty ugly. It seems like there shouldn&rsquo;t be repetition of that <code>tzinfo=None</code> statement, but that was the only was I could get it to work. The first time it occurs is because the <code>localize</code> function requires that <code>tzinfo</code> is not already set, and the second time is because the resultsing datetime objects gets another timezone attribute tacked on that messes up the pandas indexing. You&rsquo;d think that I could just set <code>tzinfo</code> to the <code>local_tz</code> and it would just work properly, but I can assure you that I tried all the simpler possibilities first and none of them worked.</p>

<p>Anyways, I went back to that filter from the beginning of the post, and now it filters the half days properly. There are 4 remaining low-outlier days, and I cross checked these with online sources to verify that they were snow days. I added these days as a seperate list to the blacklist.</p>

<p>The filter currently runs as:</p>

<pre><code>df_school = egz.time_filter(df_energy,
                        include = ('9/2/16','6/16/17'),
                        blacklist = no_school + half_day
                        + ['2/9/17','2/13/17','3/14/17','3/15/17'],
                        daysofweek=[0,1,2,3,4],
                        times=('07:40','14:20'))
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a nice unimodal distribution of the main power usage <em>just</em> during school hours. You can visually see that blob sticking off to the right which probably is a sign of power waste.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will start working on the functional implemetation of anomaly detection.</p>
