<h2 id="finally-working">Finally working</h2>

<p>With the suggestions from Jordan I was able to get the server running locally on my system.</p>

<p>Some things I did differently (starting from the latest version on GitHub):</p>

<ul>
<li>I set the admin password for the default <code>postgres</code> account and used those credentials in the development settings file rather than the credentials for the <code>myusername</code> user account that Kevin had me make on Wed.</li>
<li>I dropped the existing database and made a new one.</li>
<li>I still had to delete the existing migrations folders, but this time I individually ran <code>makemigrations</code> for <code>energize_andover</code> and then <code>bacnet</code> followed by a generic <code>migrate</code> command.</li>
<li>I ran <code>python manage.py setup</code> to create the admin account rather than using <code>createsuperuser</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
After this I was able to <code>python manage.py runserver</code> and log in successfully. I&rsquo;ve never used this interface myself but from the demos I&rsquo;ve seen I generally knew how to add a school from the provided CSV files. I still get an error from some processes like the QR generator.</p>

<h2 id="poking-around">Poking around</h2>

<p>I started looking around the source files to see how things work. The realtime grapher is the main source of interest for me.</p>

<p>The process consists of two parts. One is using BACnet to make a log of values in a CSV file, the other is to use that CSV file to plot the recorded values on the webpage.</p>

<p>That sounds promising (if the page can plot the recorded values it can plot the predictions), but one difficulty is a discrepancy of formatting. The CSV log currently is a big stream of recordings with the panel, units, and school name as labels attached to each measurement.</p>

<p>The files that I&rsquo;ve been working with have the panel and units as headers and each entry is just logged along with a timestamp. I can see how the former approach is easier to implement, but it makes things a little messy and I can&rsquo;t plug that kind of file into the forecast model.</p>

<p>It does seem that this involves storing a lot of redundant information. Every entry stores &ldquo;Andover High School&rdquo; as the associated school name, it would seem cleaner to just store this value once and associate the name with the filename.</p>

<h4 id="solutions">Solutions</h4>

<p>I see a couple of approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directly change the format of the recorded data sheet.</li>
<li>Parse the existing data sheet into a different format.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
I will have to discuss this with Kevin and see what he thinks. Another thing, we&rsquo;re only logging values for AHS at the moment so it doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary yet to include the school name with data points (the AHS name is currently hardcoded into the logging script).</p>

<p>I think the idea is that the <code>trend.csv</code> file will hold all the trend data for every school. Another approach would be to make seperate trend files for each school to keep things organized.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea of the structure I had in mind:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">trends
 |___ 1
 |    |___ trend.csv
 |    |___ pred_vals.csv
 |    |___ pred_stds.csv
 |
 |___ 2
 |    |___ trend.csv
 |    |___ pred_vals.csv
 |    |___ pred_stds.csv
 |
 |___ 3
      |___ trend.csv
      |___ pred_vals.csv
      |___ pred_stds.csv
</code></pre></p>

<p>Each number corresponds to a school ID. I know that this system is already in place since it is used to create the grapher URL (e.g. Graph1 is for AHS). And the <code>trend.csv</code> file would look more like:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Timestamp</th>
<th>Main (kW)</th>
<th>DHB (kW)</th>
<th>DG (kW)</th>
<th>DE (kW)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2017-08-04 16:45:00</td>
<td>112.019</td>
<td>62.227</td>
<td>49.937</td>
<td>32.541</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2017-08-04 17:00:00</td>
<td>110.128</td>
<td>61.847</td>
<td>56.039</td>
<td>31.119</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>and so on (those are mostly just random numbers).</p>

<p>Then I could plug <code>trend.csv</code> into a <code>MultiRFModel</code> to create <code>pred_vals.csv</code> and <code>pred_stds.csv</code> for each school. This would imply that every type of information being recorded would be modeled and predicted. This may not be necessary, so perhaps I should add a parameter to the models to restrict which columns are modeled and predicted.</p>

<p>Another thing that worries me is the fact that currently, <code>trend.csv</code> is not at strict 15-minute marks. The points are more or less 15 minutes apart, but they are not precisely stored at 00:00, 00:15, 00:30, etc. Instead it&rsquo;s more like 2017-08-10 11:44:16. The model would be pretty strict about having perfect data freqeuncy so we&rsquo;ll want to round the timestamps to the nearest 15-minute mark.</p>
