Not much new to post about today. I worked with Frank and Ajay this morning to go over a detailed explaination of how to perform some core pandas operations.

We covered how to read in the CSV file, how to use the `ical_ranges` and `time_filter` functions in the `energize` module, various visualization methods like line plots and histograms, and data indexing methods.

We're going to go over some more examples tomorrow, and hopefully by the end of the week we'll be ready to get back to work on the actual problem statement.
