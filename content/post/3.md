Now that I have a better idea of the current data distribution, I should think about how to use that info to analyze the data. For now I will continue to focus on the night data since it's reasonable to assume that there should be little power usage or variation going on during these hours.

With a normal distribution, the two constants we would want to consider are the `mean` and the `standard deviation`. However, as we say yesterday, our data set does not follow a normal distrubution. I am not certain that it even **should** follow a normal distribution. For example, what if a building finds a way to use zero power at night, with some variation extending to the right. It's not possible to use negative power so it's impossible for that to be a normal distribution. This is obviously not likely to happen, but it still demonstrates how its easy for data points to pile up on the lower end of the scale, causing a tail to emerge off the right. The goal nonetheless is to reduce the presence of this tail.

Since we are not dealing with a normal distribution, it would be more appropriate to consider the data's `median` and `median absolute deviation`, or MAD. These measures are less influenced by data outliers and tails since they are concerned with the midpoint of the distribution by volume rather than by value.

... to be continued ...
