Another brief post today. I spent another session going over the remainder of the energize module (`unstack_by_time`, `plot_normal` and `trapz`).

I also went over python features like `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and list comprehension.

That's all I can really think of that needs to be covered, so tomorrow we're going to meet at the library to start planning the actual work that needs to get done.
