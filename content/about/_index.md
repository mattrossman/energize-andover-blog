You can find (some) of the code and resources I'm using on the GitHub repository [located here](https://github.com/mattrossman/andover-energy-analysis).

This blog is published on GitHub Pages. It is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site tool, based off the [Cactus Plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus) theme.

Want to make a blog like this one? [Read my guide]({{< ref "how-to.md" >}}) for a breakdown of how to get started.

[Energize Andover](http://www.energizeandover.com/) is an effort through the town of Andover to find ways to improve energy efficiency of its public buildings. This summer, I am working on software to analyze the parsed Metasys data for ways to decrease unnecessary energy usage.


This will be accomplished primarily with the Anaconda distribution of the Python programming language.
