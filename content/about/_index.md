[Energize Andover](http://www.energizeandover.com/) is an effort through the town of Andover to find ways to improve energy efficiency of its public buildings. In the Summer of 2017, I am working on software to analyze Metasys data for ways to decrease unnecessary energy usage.


This will be accomplished by using the Anaconda distribution of the Python programming language.
