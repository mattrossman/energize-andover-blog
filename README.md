# energize-andover-blog

This is my blog tracking my work on the Energize Andover project.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages (see static files in the `docs` directory).

It is built with Hugo static site generator.

You can read a guide on how to make a blog like it [here](https://mattrossman.github.io/energize-andover-blog/appendix/how-to/)
