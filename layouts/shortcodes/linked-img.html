<!---- linked-img

This lets you place an image that:
1. Links to its own source
2. Builds a path by /images/month/day/param to make image placement easier.

Example:

For a post with the date set to 09/14/17 :

{ { < linked-img "my-img.png" > } }

will display the image located at /images/09/14/my-img.png
which you can click to display the full image.

Note to remove the extra spaces between brackets, they are placed so this comment works properly.

<a href='{{ .Site.BaseURL }}images/{{ .Page.Date.Format "01" }}/{{ .Page.Date.Format "02" }}/{{ .Get 0 }}'>

	<img src='{{ .Site.BaseURL }}images/{{ .Page.Date.Format "01" }}/{{ .Page.Date.Format "02" }}/{{ .Get 0 }}'
	alt="{{ .Get 0 }} not found"/>
</a>

<!-- FOR THE CURIOUS

The way to get a YYYY-MM-DD date is calling { { .Date.Format "2006-01-02" } }

As such, MM aligns with "01" and DD aligns with "02"

Calling these formats independently lets you pull the month and day values.

This helps me organize my image files by post date.
