<!-- linked-img

This lets you place an image that:
1. Links to its own source
2. Can build a path by /images/month/day/param to make image placement easier.

The latter option applies when the URL does not begin with "http"

Example:

For a post with the date set to 09/14/17 :

{ { < linked-img "my-img.png" > } }

will display the image located at /images/09/14/my-img.png
which you can click to display the full image.

Note to remove the extra spaces between brackets, they are placed so this comment works properly.

{{ $month := .Page.Date.Format "01" }}
{{ $day   := .Page.Date.Format "02" }}
{{ $.Scratch.Add "src" (.Get 0) }}
{{ if ne (substr (.Get 0) 0 4) "http" }}
    {{ $.Scratch.Set "src" (printf "%simages/%s/%s/%s" .Site.BaseURL $month $day (.Get 0)) }}
{{ end }}

<div align="center">
	<a href={{ $.Scratch.Get "src" }}>
	   <img src={{ $.Scratch.Get "src" }} alt="{{ .Get 0 }} not found" title = {{ .Get 0 }} />
	</a>
</div>

<!-- FOR THE CURIOUS

The way to get a YYYY-MM-DD date is calling { { .Date.Format "2006-01-02" } }

As such, MM aligns with "01" and DD aligns with "02"

Calling these formats independently lets you pull the month and day values.

This helps me organize my image files by post date.
